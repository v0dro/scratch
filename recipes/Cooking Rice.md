# Cooking Rice

## Normal Rice

1 wati -> 1.5 wati water to make it little loose.

More water you put, more pasty it will become. Less water, more loose rice (good for things like Biryani).

## Herbal Rice

This is used in continental curries, can be brown or white.

1 wati -> 1.5 wati water.

* Wash the rice twice.
* Add pinch of salt.
* Little butter and herbs.

## Biryani Rice

1 wati -> 1 wati water

* Wash twice and add little salt.

## Cooker setup

* Put little water in the cooker.
* Put the zhali at the bottom.
* Put a half lemon on the sides to keep the cooker clean.
* More the cooking you want, more the food should go towards the bottom. Like dals or herbed rice.
