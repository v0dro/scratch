# Recipes

Lists some of the recipes I've learned.

Here's a general list of names and what they mean:

## Dals

* Yellow and flat - Tur dal (used in varan and amti)
* Orange and flat - Masoor dal (high protein, mix with other dals)
* Round and dark yellow - Chana dal (used less cuz it is tough to digest)
* Small yellow oval - Moong dal (used for making khicdi, easy to digest)

## Rice

* Long grain - Basmati
* Smaller grain - Ambe mohr (easy to digest, combine with khicdi)
